# OS-Scheduler
Operating systems scheduling algorithms visualization.
it is an OS scheduler using different scheduling algorithms
This module is responsible for generating a schedule for the current processes in the system to specify the
CPU usage by these processes.
implemented 4 scheduling algorithms:
1. Non-Preemptive Highest Priority First.(HPF)
2. First Come First Served. (FCFS)
3. Round Robin with fixed time quantum.(RR)
4. Preemptive Shortest Remaining Time Next.(SRTN)

Library used for GUI : Tkinter  
Library used for plots : matplotlib
